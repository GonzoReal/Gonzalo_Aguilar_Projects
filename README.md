#### Objectve: Summarize the data and interpret all conclusions 




### Collecting the data 

Many tabs later I found the dataset I wanted to work with and lucky for me it was in a pretty looking table waiting for me 
to grab

So I used Google Sheets IMPORTHTML() fuction to import the data into a spreadsheet it looked even prettier!!! when the dataset 
was in my spreadhseet
