#### Project overview

Analyzing a life-long passion of mine which is gaming! and no better
way to do that by interpreting a dataset I extracted from the web

#### Objectve: Summarize the data and interpret all conclusions 


###Collecting the data 

Many tabs later I found the dataset I wanted to work with and lucky for me it was in a pretty looking table waiting for me 
to grab

So I used Google Sheets IMPORTHTML() fuction to import the data into a spreadsheet
